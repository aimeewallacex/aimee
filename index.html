<p> body language in cats... you can tell a lot about a cats mood by their tail. cats have sevral signs that can show overstimulation. </p>
 if a cats tail is upright and slightly curved at the top and/or walking towards you, this is a friendly greeting. </p>
<p> a cats slow blink is a sign of trust and love. a cat having their tummy exposed is another sign of trust. </p>
 if a cat stares without blinking, this could be them feeling curious or suprised- but also staring at your cat to them can seem like aggression! </p>
